# LinearInverseKsn
Calculate the normalized steepness index using a linear inverse method, and find the best-fit concavity.

This is a heavily modified version of the INCA code by Adam Smith.
The original INCA code can be found here: https://github.com/adamsmith142/INCA
The method is described by Adam and Fox (2024, https://doi.org/10.1029/2023JF007584) and Smith et al. (2022, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.103970).
The Clearwater DEM used as an example can be found at DOI: 10.17632/pbppkd7gwn.1, and the outlet.kml file to use with it can be found in the INCA repository.
